    <p> insert test here We are a simple team of three CS students working to make a Secure Online Payment System, called Easy Pay!</p>
    <p> We are working to practice securing sample user information with a simple demo website that will simulate an online payment system. Users will be able to do the following:</p>
        <ul>   
            <li> Create an Account that will be stored on a MySQL database </li>
            <li> Login at anytime with a secure password as well as the usage of MFA </li>
            <li> Add/Remove money to their Easy Pay account </li>
            <li> Send "money" to other users in our system</li>
            <li> Change account information</li>
        </ul>
